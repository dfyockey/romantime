RomanTime - A simple utility for displaying the current time in Roman numerals.

Useful for creating a Roman digital clock.

With gcc installed, use the following to compile...
    g++ -o RomanTime RomanTime.cpp

There really aren't any instructions for use. Run it, and it prints the current time
in Roman numerals to standard output. What's done with the output is up to the user.
